# Description
Our goal is to enable users to analyze car data that was part of the 1983 Exposition of Statistical Graphics Technology. There are 406 cars included in this dataset; each car has a set of attributes including: 
MPG (miles per gallon), number of cylinders, engine displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, and the region of origin. In our analysis, we will be specifically looking at car performance as a variable of acceleration (the time in seconds it takes the car to accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour). We also segmented our data into 4 views--an overview of all cars and each region of origin (U.S.A, Europe, and Japan) so viewers can see the trends within each region.
